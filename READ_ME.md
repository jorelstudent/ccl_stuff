So this folder has the parameter values, the CLASS and CCL generated data files, and the plots of the 
statistics. There's also a folder called py_code which has the .py file for creating the statistics.

In the folder CCL it has the .dat files generated by CCL, so the first column has the wavenumber (k) values
the second column has the matter power spectrum values (Pk), assuming linearity, and the third column 
has the Pk values, assuming nonlinearity.

In the folder CLASS, it has three subfolders. The lin and nonlin basically have the same thing, but one assumes
a linear model and the other assumes a nonlinear model, respectively. The first column has the k values and the 
second columns has the Pk values, linear or nonlinear depending on which subfolder you're in.

Inside the CLASS folder, the last subfolder is called output. It is again divided into lin and nonlin.
CLASS outputs some text, such as age of the universe. It may be useful so I included it.

The par_var.txt file has the parameters that we are varying. We are only varing 5 this time
The first column has the trial number. 
Second column has h values. 
Third column has omega_b values (NOTE: This is lower case omega. To get to Omega_b divide by h^2)
Fourth column has omega_cdm values (NOTE: SImilar as above)
Fifth column has the A_s values
Sixth column has n_s values

In the plots folder, it just contains the plots of the CCL and CLASS values, along with a graph comparing the 
differences. We want it to be less than 10^-4.

The py_code folder has the .py file of generating the statistics, so if you want to look at different scales or 
different colors, just change the path, to the specific data files, then you should be good to go.
