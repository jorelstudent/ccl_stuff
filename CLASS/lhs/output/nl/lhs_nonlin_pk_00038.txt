Computing primordial spectra (analytic spectrum)
Computing non-linear matter power spectrum with Halofit (including update Takahashi et al. 2012 and Bird 2014)
 -> [WARNING:] Halofit non-linear corrections could not be computed at redshift z= 0.85 and higher.
    This is probably because k_max is too small for Halofit to be able to compute the scale k_NL at this redshift.
    If non-linear corrections at such high redshift really matter for you,
    just try to increase P_k_max_h/Mpc or P_k_max_1/Mpc until reaching desired z.
